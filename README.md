High‑Level View

Presentation (Angular SPA) → Edge (API Gateway/WAF) → C# BFF (Backend‑for‑Frontend) → Domain Microservices (C# + Java) → Service-owned Datastores

Cross‑cutting: Identity & Access (OIDC), Event Bus (Kafka), Service Mesh (mTLS, retries), Observability (OTel), Secrets (Vault/KMS), Compliance/Audit.

Front End (Angular)

Modules: Customer Onboarding, Accounts, Payments/Transfers, Loans, Cards, Support/Disputes, Admin.

State & UX: NgRx or Angular Signals; optimistic UI for transfers; skeleton loading; accessibility WCAG 2.1 AA.

Security: OIDC (PKCE) login flow; short‑lived JWTs; refresh via silent renew; HTTP interceptors add tokens and correlation IDs; strict CSP; CSRF protection for same‑site flows.

API Consumption: BFF endpoints designed per-page; pagination & caching (ETag/If‑None‑Match); idempotency keys for POSTs.

Edge & Access

API Gateway + WAF: Routing, schema validation (OpenAPI/JSON Schema), rate limiting, request normalization, TLS termination, JWT verification, canary/blue‑green routing.

Identity Provider (IdP): OIDC/OAuth 2.1 with MFA, device binding, risk signals. Roles + permissions (RBAC) augmented by ABAC where needed (e.g., branch, region).

BFF Layer (C# ASP.NET Core)

Purpose: Tailored aggregates for each UI page; reduces chatty calls and shields UI from internal topology changes.

Patterns: Orchestration for multi‑step flows (Sagas); composition of C# and Java domain APIs; server‑side caching (Redis); circuit breaking, retries, bulkheads (Polly).

Protocols: REST (JSON) by default; gRPC for high‑throughput internal fan‑out; consistent correlation IDs.

Domain Microservices & Ownership

C# services (illustrative):

Identity & Access (C#): Users, roles, fine‑grained permissions, session/device management; central policy decision point.

Customer & KYC (C#): Party profiles, onboarding, document capture, KYC/KYB checks, watchlist screening integration; owns Customer master data.

Notifications (C#): Email/SMS/push; outbox + retry; templating; regulatory content controls and opt‑ins.

Fraud Risk (C#): Rule engine + ML scoring; velocity checks; device fingerprint signals; publishes risk decisions.

Java services (illustrative):

Accounts & Ledger (Java): Product catalog (checking, savings, CDs), account lifecycle, balances, statements; double‑entry ledger with journals & lines.

Payments & Transfers (Java): ACH/wire/SEPA, internal transfers, card network settlement hooks; idempotency; cutoff windows; return/reversal handling.

Loans & Underwriting (Java): Applications, pricing, credit‑policy rules, amortization schedules, servicing (payments, delinquencies).

Cards (Java): Issuing, PAN tokenization, authorization/clearing/settlement, controls (geo, MCC), disputes/chargebacks.

Each service owns its data (no shared DB). Communication is API‑first + events. Versioned APIs with backward compatibility windows.

Data & Storage (Polyglot, Service‑Owned)

Relational (Core):

Ledger schema (strict 3NF, ACID):

ledger_account(account_id, customer_id, product_type, currency, status, opened_on, closed_on)

journal_entry(entry_id, value_date, booking_date, reference_id, channel, status)

journal_line(line_id, entry_id, ledger_account_id, dc_flag, amount, currency)

Constraints: sum(debits) = sum(credits) per entry_id; FK to accounts; immutable once posted (append‑only with reversal entries).

Accounts: account, account_product, account_holder (bridge for joint accounts), balance_snapshot (read‑optimized).

Payments: payment_instruction, route, status_history, return_code, beneficiary, originator.

Loans: loan, offer, underwriting_decision, repayment_schedule, payment, delinquency_event, collateral.

Customers/KYC: party, party_address, party_doc, kyc_check, sanctions_hit, risk_profile.

Cards: card, card_token, auth_txn, clearing_txn, chargeback_case.

Document/Blob: Object store (S3/minio) for KYC documents and statements; references via content‑hash IDs in relational rows.

Search/Discovery: OpenSearch/Elastic for statements lookup, disputes, case management (denormalized, read models).

Caching: Redis for idempotency tokens, sessions, hot aggregates, rate‑limit counters.

Analytics/Lake: Event streams to a governed lakehouse with PII minimization; batch ETL and privacy‑preserving aggregates for BI.

Messaging & Integration

Event Bus (Kafka/NATS): Domain events (e.g., PaymentSettled, AccountOpened, KycVerified); protobuf/Avro schemas with evolution rules; consumer groups per service.

Outbox Pattern: Transactional outbox in each service to ensure atomic DB write + event publish.

Sagas:

Transfer Saga: debit origin → hold funds → initiate rail → confirm settlement → release hold/complete; compensations on failure.

Onboarding Saga: party create → KYC → risk score → account open → welcome kit.

External Rails: ACH/Fedwire/SEPA/card networks through specialized connectors; inbound enrichment and exception queues.

Security, Privacy & Compliance

Transport & Identity: mTLS service‑to‑service; OIDC tokens (short TTL) + service identities (SPIFFE/SPIRE) in mesh; least privilege scopes.

Data Protection: Field‑level encryption for SSN/PAN using Vault or HSM-backed KMS; tokenization for PAN; TDE + row‑level encryption as needed.

Policies & Retention: Data classification, DLP on topics and storage, configurable retention by product/regulatory zone, right‑to‑erasure workflows for non‑ledger PII.

Auditability: Tamper‑evident audit logs (WORM storage); eDiscovery exports; four‑eyes approvals for privileged actions; SOX/PCI DSS alignment.

Observability & Reliability

Tracing/Logs/Metrics: OpenTelemetry across UI, BFF, and services; SLOs per capability; RED/USE dashboards; SIEM integration for security events.

Resilience: Timeouts, retries with jitter, backoff, circuit breakers, bulkheads; idempotency keys; at‑least‑once consumers with dedupe windows.

Performance & Scale: Read replicas & partitioning for ledger; asynchronous projections for UI; CQRS read models to keep UI snappy.

DR & HA: Multi‑AZ primary; cross‑region async replication for core ledger; tested RPO/RTO; runbooks and chaos drills.

API Design & Governance

Styles: REST for CRUD/queries; gRPC for high‑throughput, low‑latency internal calls; consistent resource naming, pagination, filtering.

Versioning & Contracts: Semantic versioning; consumer‑driven contract tests (Pact); schema registries for events.

Idempotency & Concurrency: Idempotency keys on mutating endpoints; optimistic concurrency (ETags/version fields).

Delivery & Platform

Containers & Mesh: Kubernetes + Istio/Linkerd for traffic policy, mTLS, and telemetry; sidecars standardize networking.

CI/CD: Trunk‑based, gated PRs, SAST/DAST, SBOM, signed images, progressive delivery (canary/blue‑green); infra with Terraform; DB migrations with Flyway/Liquibase.

Secrets: Vault/KMS; ephemeral creds; short‑lived tokens; rotation playbooks.

Data Relationships to Call Out (Key Examples)

Customer ↔ Account (M:N via AccountHolder): supports joint accounts, business accounts with multiple authorized signers.

Account ↔ JournalLine (1:N): every movement hits two or more lines (double‑entry).

PaymentInstruction ↔ JournalEntry (1:N): a single instruction can generate multiple postings (fees, FX, network costs).

Loan ↔ RepaymentSchedule (1:N): scheduled installments; link to Payment actuals and delinquency events.

Card ↔ AuthTxn/ClearingTxn (1:N): pre‑auths, partial captures, reversals, chargebacks.
